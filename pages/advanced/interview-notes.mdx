# Notes from interviews

## MK: April 8, 2021 // 3-5 Year Prediction is the hard problem

### VP of Innovation, $4B Beauty Brand
Focused on Retailers, e.g. Presented trends report to Walmart recently (they wanted to understand source of trend insights)

### Focused on upstream Vs marketing and downstream areas
Understanding voice of customer from reviews and other sources could be interesting

### Happy with Voice of Customer and Search trend tools
Not familiar with Data mechanics but a user of services from Signals, Reviews and Spate (Google Trends)

### Seeking to forecast trends 3-5 years out
Analysis of Patent and Research data could be helpful


## MM: April 9, 2021 // Deliver impact on share of spend/category

### Head of Global Marketing Innovation, Multibillion dollar Feminine Care
Decentralized and localized strategy. Easy to measure Vs. Right to measure.
What does success in innovation look like? (not just sales, market share, share of store, etc.)

### Big Data is not being used in innovation, more in media
Some social listening and commissioned studies. Tough to integrate with purchase data and voice of customer
(e.g. complaints line). None of this data is explictly fed back into Innovation Pipeline yet. An opportunity
to integrate and monitor more holistically to guide innovation priorities.

### Easy Vs Right innovation metrics
Easy: Net sales growth (Net incrementality that captures organic decline is better, but perhaps not enough)

Right: Household penetration rates, Share of store, Share of market, Share of category would be better.
A potentially quick win to loop in entitiative high velocity Commerce share data for closing the loop on competitive set faster.

### Longer term forecasting
Analysis of Patent and Research was done internally but found to be too labor intensive and inefficient.

### Trend spotting and understanding
How are customers thinking about themes like "sustainability" in Brazil, UK, China, etc.?

### Opportunities to reduce cost of testing
Can consumer complaints, reviews and other past data be activated to reduce cost of "home use" and product testing?
To create a better model of the "ecoverse" Who, What, Why, etc. to get early reads on reaction for innovation efforts

## LS: April 9, 2021 // Make the overwhelming amount of it actionable

### Head of Marketing, Consumer facing medical technology company
"We are not using Big Data as much as we should for innovation. More for media/marketing improvement."

### Use Big Data to help us do more with less, faster
There are large gaps between pools of data available and simple ways to action them. For example:
- Understand how to engage customers more efficiently. Advertise less or more effectively (not elaborated)
- How to use social viewing and engagement data to catch trends in clothing, design, etc.
- There are so many "orphan drugs" that can be activated via DNA testing

### Opportunity to synthesize Big Data is vast
Companies like Helium are making solid progress in this space.

### Opportunity to identify competitive set and potential collaborators at scale
Using eCommerce data analysis, it is possible to create new market, competition and collaboration maps.
Enabling more creative marketing and partnership tactics by processing this data better.

### The human factors should not be forgotten
Simple interventions like "using the pace of ambient music to make plane boarding more efficient" 
can be sought out and implemented using some of the advances in data signal processing as well

## TN: April 9, 2021 // Abduction for the non obvious is whats missing

### Abduction is the opportunity ahead
Much of the tools today focus on incremental tuning of media spend and performance marketing. The big prize is ahead:
- He pointed out ('abductive reasoning') the Achilles heel of current ML methods, namely the ability to abstract
- Accelerating design thinking:  here ML could help, e.g. based on the active learning ideas, i.e. focusing on the most difficult boundary cases to get the direction of what to do next. 

### Large Brands will struggle to incorporate fast moving and granular user signals
The ability to move the needle on a multibillion dollar Brand is limited. Much of the analytics
in these cases goes to justify capital spending in the base business and market segments.
However Small bottlers producing long tail products -- I see two opportunities: moving niche to mainstream based on data, and putting the analytics data in front of the small bottlers (we tried to do it with bread distributors earlier, so it might be uphill, but who knows, given the ownership of the process is more concentrated).
