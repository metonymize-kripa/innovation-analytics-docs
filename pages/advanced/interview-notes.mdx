# Notes from interviews

## MK: April 8, 2021 {3-5 Year Prediction is the hard problem}

### VP of Innovation, $4B Beauty Brand
Focused on Retailers, e.g. Presented trends report to Walmart recently (they wanted to understand source of trend insights)

### Focused on upstream Vs marketing and downstream areas
Understanding voice of customer from reviews and other sources could be interesting

### Happy with Voice of Customer and Search trend tools
Not familiar with Data mechanics but a user of services from Signals, Reviews and Spate (Google Trends)

### Seeking to forecast trends 3-5 years out
Analysis of Patent and Research data could be helpful


## MM: April 9, 2021 {Deliver impact on share of spend/category}

### Global Marketing Innovation, Multibillion dollar Feminine Care
Decentralized and localized strategy. Easy to measure Vs. Right to measure. 
What does success in innovation look like? (not just sales, market share, share of store, etc.)

### Big Data is not being used in innovation, more in media
Some social listening and commissioned studies. Tough to integrate with purchase data and voice of customer
(e.g. complaints line). None of this data is explictly fed back into Innovation Pipeline yet. An opportunity
to integrate and monitor more holistically to guide innovation priorities.

### Easy Vs Right innovation metrics
Easy: Net sales growth (Net incrementality that captures organic decline is better, but perhaps not enough)

Right: Household penetration rates, Share of store, Share of market, Share of category would be better.
A potentially quick win to loop in entitiative high velocity Commerce share data for closing the loop on competitive set faster.

### Longer term forecasting
Analysis of Patent and Research was done internally but found to be too labor intensive and inefficient.

### Trend spotting and understanding
How are customers thinking about themes like "sustainability" in Brazil, UK, China, etc.?

### Opportunities to reduce cost of testing
Can consumer complaints, reviews and other past data be activated to reduce cost of "home use" and product testing?
To create a better model of the "ecoverse" Who, What, Why, etc. to get early reads on reaction for innovation efforts
