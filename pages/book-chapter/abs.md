# Abstract: Big Data's promise for Consumer Innovation

The exponential increase in consumer behavior and product marketing data, has not led to a corresponding increase in innovative output at leading CPG companies. A number of practical barriers remain, including limited inhouse Data Science talent, siloed data sources, mismatch in timescales between product development with rapidly changing consumer trends, and lack of integrated eCommerce and Web/Social insight mining capabilities. A number of promising advances in machine learning, e.g. Natural Language Processing and Third Wave AI, can help accelerate the use of exponential consumer data for consumer product innovation. 

Using a combination of web surveys and face to face interviews, this work identifies some of the practical concerns of leading Innovation Executives and their areas of focus. We then catalog the most promising areas of technology and illustrate their use with case studies to serve as points of departure for readers to explore ways in which these new data sets and tools can help their own innovation analytics initiatives.
