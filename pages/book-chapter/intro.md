# Introduction: Integration for impact remains the open problem


Innovation is on everyoneâ€™s mind, as shown in in Fig. 1, even more than artifi
cial intelligence, big data, and deep learning.

Obviously innovation is culture dependent, for nation scale innovation see e.g. [Kottak, 1990], for enterprise innovation see [By Udo Kopka & Patrick Simon, 2020, Kristin Behrmann, 2019].
Moreover, innovation is also a process of adaptation [George & Lin, 2017], a common feature not only of the artificial world [Simon, 2019], but also of the natural world, and as such subject to investigations resulting in finding relevant â€˜lawsâ€™ [Lamsdell & Braddy, 2010].
Notwithstanding this broader context, in the core of this article, by innovation we mean a product cycle ending with new product launch. To focus further, we will only talk about consumer product innovation. And we explicitly exclude other types of innovation: service innovation, medicines, software and platforms innovation, etc. Offering insights and a real-world framework to leverage Innovation Analytics for Competitive Advantage, from New Product Development to Operations. Enabling business models to experiment, test and learn â€“ faster, cheaper and smarter â€“ by building core competency in an emerging area of Innovation Analytics.

Innovation analytics can be defined as the use of data to enable the design and marketing of new products and services. By consumer innovation we mean a development cycle ending in a new consumer product launch. Focused particularly on advancement in the context of an exponential growth in consumer behavioral and marketing performance data via adoption of networked digital commerce, search and communication platforms (e.g. Amazon, Google, Facebook).
