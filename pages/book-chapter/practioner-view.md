# Practitioner's View: Linking quantities to qualitative decisions

While Big Data usage is common for go-to-market plans, our team sought to understand to what extent Big Data is being used to shape upstream inno- vation from Front End, disruptive innovation down to sustaining innovation. We engaged XX practitioners in the space who are actively leading innova- tion portfolios – including responsibilities across strategic “where to play” choice, in-house consumer and market understanding and project scope. Our panelists serve across a variety of CPG categories industries from food and beverage and shave care to do-it-yourself DNA test kits and paper products. 

We learned several key items when we asked practitioners which 3 key chal- lenges they would prioritize for their innovation programs. Surprisingly, they did not seek to mine the data of competitors, to bring analytics in-house or to integrate data from disparate sources such as Walmart and Amazon. Rather, their key challenges focused on 
- Defining unmet shopper needs,
- Leveraging 3rd wave analytics to predict opportunities and to forecast trends and 
- Ways to model the relative size of potential opportunities or ideas.
 
When we explored these unmet needs further, our respondents began to stitch together the challenge of managing both risk and the size of their innovation portfolio based on the level of disruption they were pursing with their portfolio and the time horizon to bring the new products to market. For instance, the bigger the capital investment, the R&D investment, the breakthrough nature of category innovation or the more competitive the category, the more value predictive analytics would offer.
