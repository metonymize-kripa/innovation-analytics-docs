# Goal of the project

Companies are looking for ways to deliver bigger and more predictably successful innovation.  We are exploring the ability to leverage Big Data from sources like Amazon, Walmart, Google, brand-com sites, search, ratings, and reviews combined with new algorithmic approaches that will let innovators and strategists like you drive stronger brand strategies and develop products faster at a lower development cost and with higher probabilities of success.
